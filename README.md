# Block News Corp
![Build All Blocklists](https://github.com/unixben/blocknewscorp/workflows/Build%20All%20Blocklists/badge.svg)

Block list of News Corporation properties.

I will happily take a pull request for adds, moves or changes.

## Which list should I use?

* If you use AdGuard, you should use [hosts_adguard.txt](hosts_adguard.txt).
* If you use PiHole, you should use [hosts_127.0.0.1.txt](hosts_127.0.0.1.txt).
* If you use uBlock Origin, you should use [hosts_adguard.txt](hosts_adguard.txt).
